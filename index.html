            <p class="st-1">Once upon a time, there was a super cool show called Ben 10! It all started when a boy named 'Ben Tennyson' found an awesome watch called the 'Omnitrix' during a summer vacation with his grandpa Max and cousin Gwen. This wasn't just any watch - it could turn Ben into different aliens with superpowers!
                 The show first came on TV in 2005. Everyone was so excited because it was all about adventure, friendship, and saving the world from bad guys. Ben was just an ordinary 10-year-old kid, but with the Omnitrix, he could become aliens like Heat blast, Four Arms, and XLR8, each with their own special powers.</p>

            class="benpic1"><br>
            <p class="st-1-2">Ben had to learn how to use the 'Omnitrix' and become a hero, even when it was tough. He fought lots of villains, like Vilgax, who wanted the Omnitrix for himself. But with the help of Gwen's magic and Grandpa Max's cool gadgets, they always found a way to win! The show became super popular, and they made more series, like *Ben 10: Alien Force, where Ben is a teenager and gets new aliens. Then came Ben 10: Ultimate Alien and Ben 10: Omniverse, with even more adventures and new friends. They even rebooted the series in 2016, starting the story all over again for a new generation of kids.</p>

            <p class="st-1-3">Watching Ben 10 was like having a front-row seat to the coolest action-packed adventures. It taught us that anyone can be a hero, no matter how young they are, and that with great power comes great responsibility. Plus, it was so much fun seeing all the different aliens and their awesome powers!

                And that's the story of Ben 10, a kid who went from normal to extraordinary, thanks to one amazing watch and a big heart.</p>

                <p class="st-2">Once upon a time, there was a beautiful, kind-hearted girl called Cinderella, who lived in a far far away land. She lived with her stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and two step-sisters, Anastasia and Drizella. As her stepmother was not very fond of her, she had asked Cinderella to live in the attic. Two cute little mice named Gus and Jaq and the chirping birds became her best friends in her new room. 


                    Her stepmother and stepsisters made her do all their household chores. Cinderella woke up early in the morning when it was still all dark to start the fire for their household. She cooked all meals, worked in the kitchen, and kept the fire going to warm their house. Poor Cinderella used to get ashes and cinders all over her clothes and body from the fire. People say her real name was Ella, but her stepsisters and stepmother called her Cinderella as she always had cinders on her clothes. 
                    
                    
                    Anastasia and Drizella were arrogant and quarrelsome. They never happened to like Cinderella much and made her life miserable. They made her run on errands for them. Cooking, sewing, and cleaning were all done by Cinderella. 
                    
                    
                    Lady Tremaine enjoyed seeing Cinderella work so hard. She cunningly gave extra work to Cinderella, like asking her to bathe her cat, Lucifer. She did everything that she could to make Lady Tremaine, Anastasia, and Drizella happy.   </p><br><br>

                        One fine morning, the king‚Äôs messengers came riding on their horses and announced that the King and the Queen had invited all the maiden ladies of the kingdom to a royal ball. The King and the Queen were to find the Prince a lovely bride. The young ladies were overjoyed with this news. They started to decide on their best ball gowns and jewellery. 


                    Soon, the king‚Äôs messenger arrived at Cinderella‚Äôs home and handed over the invitation to the ball. Lady Tremaine now ordered Cinderella to stitch two beautiful new gowns for Anastasia and Drizella for the royal ball. She kept Cinderella busy with more chores so that she wouldn‚Äôt be going to the ball. Cinderella wished to go to the ball as well. So, she found her mother‚Äôs old dress from her trunk. She thought to herself that she could make the dress into a beautiful new one fit for the royal ball. 


                     Soon, the day of the royal ball arrived, and Anastasia and Drizella were dressed up in the beautiful gowns stitched by Cinderella. Meanwhile, in the attic, Gus and Jaq, the two little mice, and the birds had turned Cinderella‚Äôs mother‚Äôs old dress into a beautiful one. They had used the ribbons and beads thrown away by Cinderella‚Äôs stepsisters to make Cinderella‚Äôs dress. 

                     Cinderella was very happy to see her new dress done by the mice and the birds. <br><br>She looked so pretty in that beautiful gown and the amazing glass slippers that the Fairy Godmother created for her. But she didn‚Äôt have a carriage to go to the ball. So, the Fairy Godmother waved her magic wand on a pumpkin and turned it into a fine carriage for Cinderella. She tapped her wand on the little mice and turned them into Cinderella‚Äôs carriage-men. 

                     The Fairy Godmother told Cinderella to go to the ball and have fun. She added, ‚ÄúRemember my child, all this magic spell will vanish at the stroke of midnight. Come back before that.‚Äù 

                     Cinderella promised to be back before midnight and left happily for the ball in the carriage drawn by Gus and Jaq. When Cinderella arrived at the palace, she was surprised to see a place so majestic and a ball so grand. There were so many young ladies escorted by their mothers. Everyone wanted to impress the Prince. But the Prince was at a loss. He didn‚Äôt know where to look or who to dance with. 

                     When Cinderella entered the royal ball, all heads turned to see her. She looked like a dream. No one happened to recognize her, even her stepmother and stepsisters were awestruck to see a girl so beautiful. Cinderella walked into the ballroom with her head held high. She looked so royal that everyone thought her to be some princess. </p><br><br>

<p class="st-2-2">The Prince was overjoyed to have found his love. He didn‚Äôt care about the cinders on her hair but looked into her eyes. ‚ÄúI found you!‚Äù he said and took Cinderella off with him. Lady Tremaine and her two daughters grew red with anger, and Cinderella‚Äôs friends Gus and Jaq rejoiced. The Prince married Cinderella and they lived happily ever after, in the palace</p>
